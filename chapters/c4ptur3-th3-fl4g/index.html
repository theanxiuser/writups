<p>This contains multiple ciphers namely </p>
<ul>
<li>Cipher 1: Base64, Because there is <code>=</code> at last. After decoding we got morse code of format <code>----- .---- .----</code>.</li>
<li>Cipher 2: Morse code, After using morse code encoding we get binary data.</li>
<li>Cipher 3: Binary to ASCII, after convering we got data like <code>fe </code>_<code>``e</code>, which is in ROt47 format</li>
<li>Cipher 4: ROT 47, we got <code>76 101 116 39 115 32 109 97 107 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 97 32 98 105 116 32 116 114 105 99 107 105 101 114 46 46 46</code>, which is in binary coded decimal format.</li>
<li>Cipher 5: BCD to ASCI, finally we got the flag. This is <code>Let's make th********************</code>.</li>

<h2 id="task-2-spectrograms">Task 2. Spectrograms</h2>
<p>We downloaded the task file. As there mention, spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. </p>
<p>We can simply use audio visualization tool like audacity to make this possible. </p>
<p>After opening file in audacity, right click on file and change option from <code>Waveform to Spectrogram</code>, there we got the flag.
And this is <code>super ****** *******</code>.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-steganography">Task 3. Steganography</h2>
<p>Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.</p>
<p>Here also need to download the task file which is a jpg file and need to revel the infromation.</p>
<p>It seems there is a text file embeeded. Here we used the tool <code>steghide</code>.</p>

</pre>
<p>From above result we can see that, passphrase is asked but this is not required so we can just ignore this. </p>

<p>Now we have the txt file and there is flag, <code>Spa**********</code>.</p>

<p>Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.</p>
<p>There is also the file, first need to download and do all required activity.</p>
<p>Current filename and extension is <code>meme_1559010886025.jpg</code>, but we need to find out first filename and extension.</p>
<p>We use this command <code>strings meme_1559010886025.jpg</code> and got the first answer as <code>hac*******.png</code> at last.</p>
<p>One line above this line we have the message, which is <code>AHH_YO**********!</code>.</p>
<p>This Challenge provides diverse field of cryptograpic problems. Which is really good to know.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking !!</p>

<p>This contains multiple ciphers namely </p>
<ul>
<li>Cipher 1: Base64, Because there is <code>=</code> at last. After decoding we got morse code of format <code>----- .---- .----</code>.</li>
<li>Cipher 2: Morse code, After using morse code encoding we get binary data.</li>
<li>Cipher 3: Binary to ASCII, after convering we got data like <code>fe </code>_<code>``e</code>, which is in ROt47 format</li>
<li>Cipher 4: ROT 47, we got <code>76 101 116 39 115 32 109 97 107 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 97 32 98 105 116 32 116 114 105 99 107 105 101 114 46 46 46</code>, which is in binary coded decimal format.</li>
<li>Cipher 5: BCD to ASCI, finally we got the flag. This is <code>Let's make th********************</code>.</li>

<h2 id="task-2-spectrograms">Task 2. Spectrograms</h2>
<p>We downloaded the task file. As there mention, spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. </p>
<p>We can simply use audio visualization tool like audacity to make this possible. </p>
<p>After opening file in audacity, right click on file and change option from <code>Waveform to Spectrogram</code>, there we got the flag.
And this is <code>super ****** *******</code>.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-steganography">Task 3. Steganography</h2>
<p>Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.</p>
<p>Here also need to download the task file which is a jpg file and need to revel the infromation.</p>
<p>It seems there is a text file embeeded. Here we used the tool <code>steghide</code>.</p>

<p>From above result we can see that, passphrase is asked but this is not required so we can just ignore this. </p>

<p>Now we have the txt file and there is flag, <code>Spa**********</code>.</p>

<p>Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.</p>
<p>There is also the file, first need to download and do all required activity.</p>
<p>Current filename and extension is <code>meme_1559010886025.jpg</code>, but we need to find out first filename and extension.</p>
<p>We use this command <code>strings meme_1559010886025.jpg</code> and got the first answer as <code>hac*******.png</code> at last.</p>
<p>One line above this line we have the message, which is <code>AHH_YO**********!</code>.</p>
<p>This Challenge provides diverse field of cryptograpic problems. Which is really good to know.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking !!</p>
